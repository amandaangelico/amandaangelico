Welcome, visitors! Iâ€™m a business professional who is endlessly curious about evolving technologies and their unique (and cumbersome) intersection with copyright law. Itâ€™s an exciting and difficult time for someone with my background; most of my experience has been in rights and clearances across legal departments within media & entertainment, protecting and monetizing IP (Sony Music, NBC, McCann, A+E Networks, etc.) Now, with advancements in GAI, the global regulatory landscape is shifting, and rights management, risk, and compliance procedures will have to follow suit.

I recognized the need to upskill in a technical direction over the past two years. NLP technologies were already on my radar since I work in a legal capacity, but I really wanted to challenge myself to understand ML on a more granular level, including ANNs/CNNs/RNNs. I wanted to understand the underlying mathematics and build machine learning models. Soâ€¦thatâ€™s what I did. This has given me a technical advantage in business because I am able to convey problems or ideas to my technology and legal counterparts in a way that they better understand. The only downside has been recognizing how few of my peers have these blended skills and understanding there will be a strong need for professionals like me in the next several years.

I encourage you to poke around my projects as I continue to add to my portfolio. For starters, you'll see recommender system projects I built during the MIT Professional Education Applied Data Science Program. More to follow! Also, please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn. Iâ€™m always open to feedback, so donâ€™t be shy if you have any.

Each course has contributed to either my technical programming skills or strategic leadership competencies. Feel free to ask about how I've applied these learnings in my work!

Next stop...Master's program in Analytics, followed by a JD once the law catches up to emerging tech (classic problem).
