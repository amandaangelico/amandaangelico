Welcome, visitors! Iâ€™m a business professional who is endlessly curious about evolving technologies and their unique (and cumbersome) intersection with copyright law. Itâ€™s an exciting and difficult time for someone with my background; most of my experience has been in rights and clearances across legal departments within media & entertainment, protecting and monetizing IP (Sony Music, NBC, McCann, A+E Networks, etc.) Now, with advancements in GAI, the global regulatory landscape is shifting, and rights management, risk, and compliance procedures will have to follow suit.

I recognized the need to upskill in a technical direction over the past two years. NLP technologies were already on my radar since I work in a legal capacity, but I really wanted to challenge myself to understand ML on a more granular level, including ANNs/CNNs/RNNs. I wanted to understand the underlying mathematics and build machine learning models. Soâ€¦thatâ€™s what I did. This has given me a technical advantage in business because I am able to convey problems or ideas to my technology and legal counterparts in a way that they better understand. The only downside has been recognizing how few of my peers have these blended skills and understanding there will be a strong need for professionals like me in the next several years.

I encourage you to poke around my projects as I continue to add to my portfolio. For starters, you'll see recommender system projects I built during the MIT Professional Education Applied Data Science Program. More to follow! Also, please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn. Iâ€™m always open to feedback, so donâ€™t be shy if you have any.
